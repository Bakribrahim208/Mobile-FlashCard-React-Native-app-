# Mobile-FlashCard-React-Native-app-

## Description

This is the third project for the [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

It is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

The app is built with React Native and was developed and tested for **Android only**.

If you want to run the application on your Android device, download the Expo app from the Google Play Store and scan the QR code which is displayed in the command like window after running `yarn start`.
